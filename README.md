# AppSync GraphQL RSS Proxy

Example project for creating an AWS AppSync GraphQL API with a custom AWS Lambda resolver in Go. All resources are created using the [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) and [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-appsync-apikey.html) resources.

***Deprecated Version:** Back in the days without AppSync support in CloudFormation, a previous release of this exampled used the AWS CLI. You can still access the CLI variant in the [`use-cli`](https://github.com/sbstjn/appsync-graphql-rss-proxy-go/tree/use-cli) branch.*
