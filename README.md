# AppSync GraphQL API with CloudFormation & SAM

Make sure to check out the [appsync-resolvers-example](https://github.com/sbstjn/appsync-resolvers-example) project for a simple example project using the [appsync-resolvers](https://github.com/sbstjn/appsync-resolvers) package to manage your GraphQL API and resolvers! You can read more about the package on [sbstjn.com](https://sbstjn.com/serverless-graphql-with-appsync-and-lambda.html).

**Outdated** example project for creating an AWS AppSync GraphQL API with a custom AWS Lambda resolver in Go. All resources are created using the [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) and [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-appsync-apikey.html) resources.

***Deprecated Version:** Back in the days without AppSync support in CloudFormation, a previous release of this exampled used the AWS CLI. You can still access the CLI variant in the [`use-cli`](https://github.com/sbstjn/appsync-graphql-rss-proxy-go/tree/use-cli) branch.*
